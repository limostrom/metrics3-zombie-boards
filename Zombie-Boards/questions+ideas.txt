Questions:
1. Would it be valuable to market check the idea? (i.e., do activists target younger/old board memembers for replacement/enagement?)
	datasets w activist involement activists would target underperforming in early years of tenure, but will only affect the tail end of the sample (maybe just carl icahn), or maybe replace an older director
2. I feel like the death of a director should matter much more in firms where shareholder rights are weak (because then they have an opportunity to put someone better on the board) than in firms where shareholder rights are strong (because then the board would already more closely resemble the optimal one, so replacing the dead board member would present less of an opportunity to reoptimize?). Then the coefficient on the change in board tenure would be less about the tradeoff between learning and entrenchment on the board, and instead more about the extent to which the shareholders' and CEO's incentives are aligned, and whether the board was already optimized to the shareholders' preferences or not.
	Caveats: (a) I don't know how shareholder rights / bargaining power are usually measured or if we have access to suitable variables we could use for that
			 (b) Maybe shareholder rights and board entrenchment are the same story? I think shareholder rights is maybe more broad or a little different / at least the possible policy solutions to the problem would be different
			 (c) They control for CEO shareholding and for classified/staggered boards - are these sufficient controls for shareholder bargaining power already?
From Francisco:
	What about general age?
	Firm age? 
	How are tenures counted after a merger?
	What about in industry, but non0firm specific experience? 
		Maybe a good instrument to pull out experience effects
		Industry specific v general management experience?
	I think the idea that a sudden death only affects firm performance through change in board tenure to be absurd
	In places with comply and explain rules, the argument of this paper seems absolutely absurd, surely only ultra high quality or ultra entrenched directors would be held
		other shapes:
			max (tenure)
			max - mean/median
			2nd longest service>?
	Kind of unsure what the actual economic significance of these results are - like a bp? Why do we care even if stat sig?
	Honestly really curious about investigating suicide stuff a good bit
	Event study - uncertainty might capture most of the effect here
		what about some measurement of quality in there too?
	Succession seems super important here - and I imagine some firms may have easier times filling spots than others
		especially firm age must matter here right?
		like it must be hard to replace a seniors board member in something start up-here
	Big v small step effects?
	Should look at the histograms of the tenure/age type variables
	I imagine there's a sparcity issue at the extreme values
	What is the policy implication of the paper?
		I guess it must come from the gov - but firms clearly shouldn't fire based solely on tenure
	CEO tenure - Board tenure as a quick and dirty measure of entrenchment?
	Other diversity variables?
	Curious about some general firm performance statistics with the data here

"barbarians at the gate" style M&A - more of an 80s thing though

From Bohan:
- About square term:
	1. Are there enough observations on the right side of the "best tenure"?
	2. Maybe need to control the square term of firm age
- About death sample:
	1. They did not use a panel model - only cross-sectional regressions
	2. What about using sudden death as IV?


CEO fixed effects- tenure 2 years doesn't make sense

If you replaced an indirect director with an insider, that should have different implication than if you replaced them with another outsider

Sparsely populated observations for high tenure

If you die before the shareholder meeting - sometimes the board replaces them and sometimes the shareholders, might be different (esp. when board meetings are infrequent)

Bebchuk index of CEO entrenchment; something related to proposals 
- skim through provisions - the whole thing is insane but individual ones 
-shareholder special meetings?
-freq of meetings
Activist dataset - everyone w/ board replacement demand
Director ownership
-new director appointments related to existing interlocks

disentangling firm experience vs industry experience
	->if the replacement for an outsider is in the same industry vs different industry

Other Thoughts:
1. Usually when a paper has an event study but doesn't show the plots it's because the plots look like garbage

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To Do:
-Annoying data things:
	-Match legacy_pps_id with gvkey for the director legacy dataset from WRDS (fuzzy merge will probably mostly work) - Andrew & Pietro
	-meetingdate to datadate match - these dates don't line up exactly so (I think) we need to match whichever ones are the closest to each other and then go from there - Francisco
	-
-Actually replicate main table 
-Choose a direction for the extension (identify one specific source of endogeneity to target for additional analyses)
