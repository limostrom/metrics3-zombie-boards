Questions:
1. Would it be valuable to market check the idea? (i.e., do activists target younger/old board memembers for replacement/enagement?)
2. I feel like the death of a director should matter much more in firms where shareholder rights are weak (because then they have an opportunity to put someone better on the board) than in firms where shareholder rights are strong (because then the board would already more closely resemble the optimal one, so replacing the dead board member would present less of an opportunity to reoptimize?). Then the coefficient on the change in board tenure would be less about the tradeoff between learning and entrenchment on the board, and instead more about the extent to which the shareholders' and CEO's incentives are aligned, and whether the board was already optimized to the shareholders' preferences or not.
	Caveats: (a) I don't know how shareholder rights / bargaining power are usually measured or if we have access to suitable variables we could use for that
			 (b) Maybe shareholder rights and board entrenchment are the same story? I think shareholder rights is maybe more broad or a little different / at least the possible policy solutions to the problem would be different
			 (c) They control for CEO shareholding and for classified/staggered boards - are these sufficient controls for shareholder bargaining power already?
From Francisco:
	What about general age?
	Firm age? 
	How are tenures counted after a merger?
	What about in industry, but non0firm specific experience? 
		Maybe a good instrument to pull out experience effects
		Industry specific v general management experience?
	I think the idea that a sudden death only affects firm performance through change in board tenure to be absurd
	In places with comply and explain rules, the argument of this paper seems absolutely absurd, surely only ultra high quality or ultra entrenched directors would be held
		other shapes:
			max (tenure)
			max - mean/median
			2nd longest service>?
	Kind of unsure what the actual economic significance of these results are - like a bp? Why do we care even if stat sig?
	Honestly really curious about investigating suicide stuff a good bit
	Event study - uncertainty might capture most of the effect here
		what about some measurement of quality in there too?
	Succession seems super important here - and I imagine some firms may have easier times filling spots than others
		especially firm age must matter here right?
		like it must be hard to replace a seniors board member in something start up-here
	Big v small step effects?
	Should look at the histograms of the tenure/age type variables
	I imagine there's a sparcity issue at the extreme values
	What is the policy implication of the paper?
		I guess it must come from the gov - but firms clearly shouldn't fire based solely on tenure
	CEO tenure - Board tenure as a quick and dirty measure of entrenchment?
	Other diversity variables?
	Curious about some general firm performance statistics with the data here


From Bohan:
- About square term:
	1. Are there enough observations on the right side of the "best tenure"?
	2. Maybe need to control the square term of firm age
- About death sample:
	1. They did not use a panel model - only cross-sectional regressions
	2. What about using sudden death as IV?

Extension Ideas:
1. 


--------------------------------------------------------------
Other Thoughts:
1. Usually when a paper has an event study but doesn't show the plots it's because the plots look like garbage

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To Do:
-Annoying data things:
	-Match legacy_pps_id with gvkey for the director legacy dataset from WRDS (fuzzy merge will probably mostly work)
	-meetingdate to datadate match?
	-
-Actually replicate main table 
-Choose a direction for the extension (identify one specific source of endogeneity to target for additional analyses)
***Set up meeting time with CH -- i feel like we just need to do this to give us a hard deadline to have Things
